prompt1=f""" Extract every dimension, number, notation, symbol, text, and structural element from this RCC structural design drawing image. Be exhaustiveâ€”scan every pixel, including all grid panels, beam labels, notes, tables, and annotations, without missing any detail, no matter how small or repetitive. Prioritize reinforcement details: identify every bar type (e.g., Y8, Y10, with diameter in mm), spacing (e.g., @7\"c/c, in inches/mm), location (e.g., top/bottom, panel A-1 to B-2, beam FB1), direction (e.g., horizontal/vertical), and exact position. Note variations per panel or section individually. Organize into: Drawing Information, Personnel & Consultants, Revision History, Grid System & Dimensions, Slab Specifications, Reinforcement Details by Panel/Section, Beam Details & Schedule, Material Specifications, Cover & Development Requirements, Building Classification, General Notes, Miscellaneous Codes/Symbols, Hatched/Shaded Areas. For each item, list: - What it is (e.g., \"Y8@7\"c/c top\"). - Where it appears (e.g., panel B-2 to C-3, note 5, beam schedule row 2). - What it represents (e.g., tensile reinforcement, shear stirrups). Detect the scale from the drawing (e.g., 1:60 in the title block) and apply it to all dimensions and measurements, providing the actual building size (not drawn size), approximate drawn length on paper, and metric conversions (feet-inches to meters, inches to mm, bar diameters in mm). Use bullet points. End with a \"Summary of All Numeric Data\" table with columns: Value, Units, Metric, Location, Purpose. Cross-reference notes and symbols.
