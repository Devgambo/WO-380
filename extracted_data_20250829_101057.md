**Notes:**

*   All measurements are approximate due to the limitations of image resolution and OCR accuracy.
*   The "Y" in "Y8", "Y10", etc., denotes a type of high-yield strength deformed bar.
*   "c/c" stands for center-to-center spacing.
*   The drawing scale (1:60) was used to convert drawing measurements to actual dimensions.

I have attempted to be as exhaustive as possible. Please let me know if you have any specific questions or require further clarification.
