**Summary of All Numeric Data**

| Value | Units | Metric (mm) | Location | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1995 | mm | 1995 | Grid A-B | Distance between grid lines |
| 1900 | mm | 1900 | Grid B-C | Distance between grid lines |
| 4000 | mm | 4000 | Grid C-D | Distance between grid lines |
| 4165 | mm | 4165 | Grid D-E | Distance between grid lines |
| 2330 | mm | 2330 | Grid E-F | Distance between grid lines |
| 3780 | mm | 3780 | Grid F-G | Distance between grid lines |
| 4080 | mm | 4080 | Grid G-H | Distance between grid lines |
| 3970 | mm | 3970 | Grid 1-2 | Distance between grid lines |
| 1730 | mm | 1730 | Grid 2-3 | Distance between grid lines |
| 300 | mm | 300 | Grid 2-3 | Distance between grid lines |

**Scale Conversion**

*   The drawing scale is 1:50. This means that 1 unit on the drawing represents 50 units in reality.

**Example Calculation:**

*   Dimension on drawing: 1995 mm
*   Actual dimension: 1995 mm * 50 = 99750 mm = 99.75 meters

**Important Notes:**

*   This analysis is based solely on the provided image.
*   Without reinforcement details, a complete structural assessment is impossible.
*   Always refer to the full set of drawings and specifications for accurate construction.
