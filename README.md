# Automated IS Code Compliance Checker for Structural Design Drawings

## 🚀 Project Overview

Manual verification of structural design drawings for IS code compliance is a **tedious, error-prone, and time-consuming process.** This project brings cutting-edge automation to civil engineering workflows by transforming structural drawings (PDFs) into machine-checked compliance reports using document parsing, OCR, and intelligent rule engines.

> Imagine uploading your RCC slab drawing and—within moments—receiving a detailed report that highlights every conforming and non-conforming measurement, each one checked against the relevant Indian Standards (IS 456, IS 1786, IS 13920, and more). No more missed errors, no more guesswork—just **peace of mind and regulatory confidence**!

## 🔍 What Does This System Do?

- **Uploads Structural Design PDFs Straight from Your Desktop**
- **Parses and Extracts** critical information, including:
  - Dimensions, bar diameters, spacings
  - Reinforcement details, cover depths
  - Concrete and steel grades
- **Validates Every Parameter** against IS codes by:
  - Checking minimum/maximum values and formulas
  - Flagging any non-conformities with clear, actionable feedback
- **Generates Professional-Grade Compliance Reports** in seconds

## ✨ Why This Project Matters

- **Faster Design Approvals:** Slash the time from submission to regulatory approval.
- **Fewer Mistakes:** Minimize costly rework and site delays.
- **Enhanced Safety:** Ensure every drawing meets the highest standards of structural integrity.
- **First-of-its-Kind Automation:** Blends document AI, machine learning, and civil engineering knowledge.
