**Notes:**

*   Bar diameters (Y8, Y12, Y16) are approximate conversions from the "Y" designation, which typically refers to a high-yield steel bar.  The exact diameter would need to be confirmed based on the specific steel standard used.
*   Metric conversions are approximate.
*   The exact location and extent of the hatched areas would require further analysis of the drawing.
